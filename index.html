                This application was inspired by a father on TikTok who replicated a conversation to allow women to download his video and use it when they are in an Uber alone, which offered the user, specifically women, the comfort of having a conversation wherever they go.

                In society, human trafficking cases lacks equitible data recordings in comparison to other crimainal cases, such as burglary. The criminal justice system also lacks equal investigation qualities and motivation when crimes involve female-dominated victims. Additionally, thousands of U.S rape cases are recorded in the police department every year and there has yet to be accountability to the perpetrators and liability to these victims, specifically women.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the light of a COVID world, we have recognized that safety has taken a more important role as the dangers of human trafficking and women saftey should be one of our top priorities despite higher institutionsâ€™ lack of motivation to develop quality and equitable preventions.

            <p class="text-white pt-2">
                We wanted to create an application that would offer users a way to connect with family and friends when their safety is compromised. Many women often fear walking or traveling alone, so our app allows users to share their location with desired contacts and play pre recorded videos to emulate a facetime or voice call to provide companionship when users feel alone.

                Tutela is a non-profit aiding women-identifying individuals who are disproportionately impacted by gender-based violence and human trafficking in which we provide a solution to personal safety, security, and independence by bringing our communities together and building a stronger safety net so we can feel more comfortable doing daily tasks.

                Women do feel more afraid in particular physical environments. Because women cannot lead their lives if they are fearful of all men all the time, in order to maintain an illusion of control over their safety they need to know where and when they may encounter 'dangerous men' in order to avoid them. To do this they develop mental images of where violence occurs which are developed through the complex interaction and cumulative effect of first- and second-hand information sources. Through using these sources of information women transfer their threat appraisal from men to dangerous environmental contexts. Women's collective definition and avoidance of these contexts therefore creates social norms about women's appropriate use of space.
